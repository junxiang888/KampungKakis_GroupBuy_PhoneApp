Kampung Kakis was created for a post Pandemic situation where people are used to the online delivery services due to the pandermic situation
However, online purchases are shyed away from due to its delivery cost. Having to pay an additional cost on a daily basis makes users think twice about their purchase online. 
This both affects their purchases and also the frequency of purchase.

Therefore with Kampung Kakis, we aim to solve this issue mainly on daily food dliveries since its more frequent than other online deliveries.
Not only this, we also hope to promote singapore hawker foods as part of this application efforts

More information on the pain and gains can be found in the ppt attached.

In this application, users have to select which hawker they wish to purchase their food from for the next day, and wait for the votes to come up for the final decisions. The majority will get the food court they want and everyone will start to then order from the application where the delivery fee will be split amongst all the users that ordered the food. This will give them a lesser delivery fee for each users, making it more affordable.
